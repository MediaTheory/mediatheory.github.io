<div class='col-md-6 words p-4'>The great thing about our brains being so malleable is that we can interrupt the cycle and train it to become more tolerant (and hopefully crave) more long form, nuanced information in addition to its tendency to enjoy simplified information.  To make adjustments within the current media landscape to mitigate these influences, some suggestions include taking weekly digital breaks where you read only printed material, news or otherwise. Varying types of stories, such as those from traditional news sources and web based content, can keep your brain ready for either. One must employ critical thinking skills and apply that to all types of information encountered. Another best practice suggested is setting digital boundaries, such as no screen time after a certain time of day. Some people even take digital breaks once a week where for an entire day no digital devices are used. We are not going to ever be able to escape the digital world and its tendency to shift pathways. We can ensure that one does not come to completely depend on the digital onslaught and have the anxiety caused by not constantly checking a phone or computer can lessen.<br></div>
